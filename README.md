# Weather App

This is a simple Weather & Time application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Mantine, and Tailwind CSS. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays:

- The local time and weather conditions of a searched city.
- The temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (toggle).
- The time difference between the userâ€™s local time and the city.
